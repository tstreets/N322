## Project Overview
This app is a tool for companies to manage their employees' schedules. Employees are able to view their current schedules and update their availability for future weeks. Managers are able to create and update weekly schedules, while doing so they will see the availibilty of their employees. When joining the app, new users will need a special code given to each company. There will be one code for employees and one for managers.
